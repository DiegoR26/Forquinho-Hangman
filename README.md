# Forquinho-Hangman

<h1>Hey everyone!</h1>

This is a JS Hangman game in pt-br <br>

That's my very first project in JS that I made all by myself.. and stackoverflow... <br>

I'm using it to practice responsivity, querySelector, flexbox and grid.. and give myself a little bit of serotonin each time something works. <br>

You can find the project here: <br>
